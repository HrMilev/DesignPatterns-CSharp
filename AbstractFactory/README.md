# Abstract Factory Pattern

This pattern supports the creation of products that exist in families and are designed
to be produced together. The pattern isolates the product definitions and their class names from the
client so that the only way to get one of them is through a factory. For this reason,
product families can easily be interchanged or updated without upsetting the structure
of the client.
