# Strategy Pattern

The Strategy pattern involves removing an algorithm from its host class and putting it in a separate class.
It appears to change the behavior of a class without extending it.
The Strategy pattern enables a client to choose which algorithm to use from a family of algorithms and gives it a simple way to access it.
The algorithms can also be expressed independently of the data they are using.
